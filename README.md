# First-Python-GUI
# Developer: Anonymous
# Date: 12/5/24
My first GUI using Python. This code can be used to convert from Celsius and Farenheit.
For GUI, #tkinter library has been used.
For string deliver, #StringVar was used.
For #dropdown menu, #OptionMenu() was used.

(I promise it does not have a virus)
